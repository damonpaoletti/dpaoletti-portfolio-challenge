# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## My Portfolio

This is a first draft of my Portfolio website that I will be updating as I progress through the bootcamp. For now I don't have any projects
to show I will as the weeks progress. I built this project to show potentional workplaces my work,who I am and the background that I came from,
as well as an easy way to contact me. I learned a lot about different ways to style with CSS as well as further my knowledge with developing in 
HTML.
